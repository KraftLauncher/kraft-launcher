## üç¥ Forking & cloning the repository

- Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/KraftLauncher/kraft-launcher) to your account. If you already have a fork, make sure it‚Äôs up to date. 
* Clone your fork:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your_name_here>/kraft-launcher.git
    cd kraft-launcher
    ```

* Add the upstream repo:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:KraftLauncher/kraft-launcher.git
    ```

    This allows you to fetch updates from the main repository.

## üß™ Testing

To run tests:

* **Unit tests**: 

    ```bash
    # REPLACE "package_name" with the given package name 
    cd package_name
    flutter test
    ```

* **End-to-end (E2E) tests**: 

    ```bash
    # REPLACE "package_name" with the given package name
    cd package_name
    flutter test integration_test
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> In this project, the UI is generally not as heavily tested as the business logic.

> [!TIP]
>  Useful testing resources:
> - [Flutter unit tests](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/introduction).
> - [Mock dependencies using Mockito](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/unit/mocking).
> - [Flutter widget tests docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Notes

- Run `(cd kraft_launcher && flutter gen-l10n)` when updating localization `.arb` files in [l10n](./l10n/) directory. Also update `AppLanguage` enum when adding new localizations, a unit test will fails if not in sync.
- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` or [`fluttergen`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen#usage) when adding and deleting files inside the `assets` directory.
- Run `dart ./scripts/generate_pubspec_dart_code.dart` when updating `pubspec.yaml`.

> [!NOTE]
> To reduce visual clutter in the editor, generated files like `*.g.dart` and `*.freezed.dart` are hidden from the VS Code Explorer via project-specific settings in `.vscode/settings.json`. These files are **not removed**‚Äîthey're still part of the codebase and used during compilation. You can temporarily unhide them by modifying or disabling the `files.exclude` setting in VS Code if needed.
